# Triacetic-Acid-Lactone-TAL-bioproduction
**The simulations include Aspen Plus and SuperPro Designer files, which are essential for reproducing the results and analyses presented in the paper.
The directory contains the following files:**
1) Aspen Plus Files: .apw. The working file for the Aspen Plus simulation model.
2) SuperPro Designer Files:.spf. The main file for the SuperPro Designer simulation.

**Purpose: To model the biochemical production process of Triacetic Acid Lactone (TAL) and analyze the techno-economic performance.**
Primary Reference: The data and models used in these simulations are based on the paper: "Toward Net-Zero Greenhouse Gas Emission: Techno-Economic and Life Cycle Analyses of Routes for Triacetic Acid Lactone (TAL) Bioproduction."
Additional Resources: Refer to the supporting information (SI) section of the paper for detailed assumptions, input data, and methodology.
